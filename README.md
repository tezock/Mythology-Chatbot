## Inspiration

As someone who has always been fascinated by storytelling, when I took the class Intro to Ancient Mythology at The University of Texas at Austin, I found myself asking: what if we could bring these timeless figures into the modern world? What lessons would they have for us today, and how might they interpret the challenges we face in our own lives?

This curiosity sparked the idea behind MythChat, a project born from my interest for technology. MythChat offers users a chance to interact with mythological figures in a way that feels dynamic, engaging, and, most importantly, relevant. Using GPT-4â€™s powerful language model capabilities, the project allows users to have insightful conversations with the likes of Zeus, Athena, and other legendary figures, all from the comfort of their own browser.

Beyond just being a fun tool to explore these myths, MythChat also represents my journey in learning and implementing web interfaces. The development process has allowed me to sharpen my skills in React, APIs, and deployment pipelines, turning an idea into a functional, interactive web experience.## Built With
